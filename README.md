# A Bootstrap 4 template for your next website
This is a template that you can use for your next website (for yourself, your company, or any client). It is very easy to
edit, extend and publish. Feel free to use an HTML editor, or a simple text editor.

There are no requirements for running this project. A CDN is used to load the Bootstrap contents.

## Directories
Apart from the index.html file where the content is located, you have separate folders for css, js (JavaScript),
images and icons.

## Based on Bootstrap 4
Bootstrap 4 let's us build responsive, cool, mobile-first projects on the web.

Bootstrap is an open source toolkit (framework) for developing with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With Bootstrap, we can easily and quickly prototype ideas or build apps featuring various components, a responsive grid system, plugins, and a lot more.
